*Are you facing challenges with coding in R? Do you wish to enhance your coding skills and be part of a supportive R community?*

Introducing the coding cafe by the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus! This cafe is specifically designed to establish a community where people can help each other with R coding solutions. If you are an employee of the Department of Public Health or Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, you are warmly welcomed to join us! During each session, two R assistants will be available to provide guidance, but we encourage participants to engage with and support each other.

To keep the productivity and joyfulness high there will be served cake and coffee/tea at each session.

## How can I attend?

The coding cafe is open to everyone using *R*. While we won't be teaching *R* from scratch, some experience with R coding is recommended. If you need to brush up your skills, you can check out the *Open source training solutions for R* provided below. The coding club will convene every two weeks, alternating between Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and Department of Public Health at Aarhus University.
