Do you wish to enhance your\ncoding skills and be part of a supportive R community?*\n\nIntroducing the coding cafe by the Department of Public Health, Aarhus\nUniversity, and Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus! This cafe is specifically\ndesigned to establish a community where people can help each other with\nR coding solutions. If you are an employee of the Department of Public\nHealth or Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, you are warmly welcomed to join\nus! During each session, two experienced R users will be available to\nprovide guidance, but we encourage participants to engage with and\nsupport each other.\n\nTo keep the productivity and joyfulness high there will be served cake\nand coffee/tea at each session.\n\n## How can I attend?\n\nThe coding cafe is open to everyone using *R*. We won't be teaching *R*\nfrom scratch, so some experience with R coding is recommended. If you\nneed to brush up your skills, you can check out the *Open source\ntraining solutions for R* provided below. The coding café will convene\nevery two weeks, alternating between Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and\nthe Department of Public Health at Aarhus University.\n\n## Calendar\n\n\n::: {#tbl-schedule .cell tbl-cap='Upcoming dates, times, and locations for the Café sessions.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| Week|Location |Date                  |Responsible    |Room                 |\n|----:|:--------|:---------------------|:--------------|:--------------------|\n|   35|AU-PH    |Aug 29, 13-30-14.30   |Daniel, Stefan |Lunchroom            |\n|   37|SDCA     |Sep 11, 10-12         |Luke, Daniel   |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   39|AU-PH    |Sep 21, 10-12         |Simon, Nuno    |1264-220             |\n|   41|SDCA     |Oct 10, 13.30-14.30   |Anders, Jonas  |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   43|AU-PH    |Oct. 25, 9-10         |Omar, Nuno     |Lunchroom            |\n|   45|SDCA     |Nov. 6, 10-12         |Luke, Ole      |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   47|AU-PH    |Nov. 20. 12.30 -13.30 |Simon, Jonas   |1264-220             |\n|   49|SDCA     |Dec 8, 11-12          |Anders, Omar   |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   51|AU-PH    |Dec. 19, 9-10         |Jie, Stefan    |Lunchroom            |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*SDCA: Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus in Forum at Aarhus University\nHospital*\n\n*AU-PH: Department of Public Health at Aarhus University*\n\n## Open source training solutions for R\n\nTo get started or improve your R coding abilities, you can explore the\nfollowing resources:\n\n-   Online course: [R for beginners - John\n    Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r)\n    -   Begin with *course 1* and progress through *course 5*\n    -   Primarily covers solutions in base R language\n    -   Click *enrol for free* and then press *audit* to access the\n        course without payment\n-   Online book: [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)\n    -   Offers easy data management solutions and more\n    -   Uses tidyverse language\n-   Attend Luke Johnston's R courses at the Danish Diabetes and\n    Endocrinology Academy\n    -   Start from the beginner level and advance to the more advanced\n        courses\n    -   [Stay tuned and register](https://ddeacademy.dk/events)\n    -   [Material for the three courses](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/)\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you wish to get more information about the coding cafe, please visit\nthe [coding cafe website](https://coding-cafe-sdca-au.netlify.app/) or\nfeel free to reach out to Jonas Schaarup at\n[jfrscha\\@ph.au.dk](mailto:jfrscha@ph.au.dk) or Daniel Ibsen at\n[dbi\\@ph.au.dk](mailto:dbi@ph.au.dk).\n",
