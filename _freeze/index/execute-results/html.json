The only prerequisite so far is that you have had\nsome type of introduction to R, preferably through a course such as\n[this](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/) one offered by the Danish\nDiabetes and Endocrinology Academy.\n\nThe sessions are open and one can join in and out at anytime during the\nallotted time. There will be two instructors with experience working in\nR. We also highly encourage the participants to interact with each\nother - maybe there is someone in the group that has the solution to\nyour problem.\n\nDuring the sessions there will be free cake and coffee/tea - or whatever\nis appropriate for the time of the day.\n\n## Upcoming schedule\n\n\n::: {#tbl-schedule .cell tbl-cap='Upcoming dates, times, and locations for the Café sessions.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| Week|Location |Date                  |Responsible    |Room                 |\n|----:|:--------|:---------------------|:--------------|:--------------------|\n|   35|AU-PH    |Aug 29, 13-30-14.30   |Daniel, Stefan |Lunchroom            |\n|   37|SDCA     |Sep 11, 10-12         |Luke, Daniel   |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   39|AU-PH    |Sep 21, 10-12         |Simon, Nuno    |1264-220             |\n|   41|SDCA     |Oct 10, 13.30-14.30   |Anders, Jonas  |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   43|AU-PH    |Oct. 25, 9-10         |Omar, Nuno     |Lunchroom            |\n|   45|SDCA     |Nov. 6, 10-12         |Luke, Ole      |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   47|AU-PH    |Nov. 20. 12.30 -13.30 |Simon, Jonas   |1264-220             |\n|   49|SDCA     |Dec 8, 11-12          |Anders, Omar   |Spektrummet A401-111 |\n|   51|AU-PH    |Dec. 19, 9-10         |Jie, Stefan    |Lunchroom            |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Practical information\n\n### Things to do before asking for help\nBeing a good coder in R does not necessarily mean that one just sits down and writes a lot of code like writing a piece of text. Even experienced R users search online for code. The great thing about R is that there is often multiple solutions to a coding problem. What often separates an experienced user from a new user is that the experienced user know what to search for, where to search and understand the replies.\n\nWe suggest that you try to search on either Google or directly in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). As a next step, it can be useful to use AI-tools like ChatGPT-3 but beware that it can make up functions and that it does not always work. \n\nThere are suggestions to try before asking a question.\n\n### Asking a clear coding question\nSome issues are simple such as I cannot download this package. Other times what you want to do is more complex and needs a bit of background for a person outside your project to understand what you want to do. Therefore, you need to prepare and provide the context to the person you are asking for help. This could be in the form of showing the structure of your dataset, which functions you used, and what you have tried so far. \n\n### Note about sensitive data\nMany of us work with very sensitive data - especially those working in Denmark's Statistics (DST). If you are working on DST, or something similar where you are not allowed to show the data to enyone else, you need to prepare your question a bit more. We recommend that you find an example dataset that looks similar to the dataset you work with and make a coding example. \n\n<!-- ## Blogs -->\n",
